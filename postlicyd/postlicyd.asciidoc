NAME
----

postlicyd - A postfix versatile Policy Daemon from the Postfix Tools Suite


SYNOPSIS
--------

`postlicyd [options] conf`


DESCRIPTION
-----------

+postlicyd+ is a very flexible policy daemon for postfix. It can be used as a
 replacement for tools like whitelister and postgrey. It is able to access
 R(H)BL databases by DNS or by directly reading rbldns zone files.

Features
~~~~~~~~

configuration tree::
    The configuration of postlicyd is a tree of filters. You choose what
 action to run after each filter depending on its result. The actions can be
 either running another filter or sending an
 link:http://www.postfix.org/access.5.html[answer to postfix]
 (+OK+, +DUNNO+, +REJECT+, +HOLD+, ...).
several entry points::
    a single +postlicyd+ daemon bound to a single tcp port can handle the
 requests from multiple restriction levels (+RCPT+ time, +DATA+ time, +HELO+
 time, ...). Each restriction level is associated to an entry point in the
 configuration tree.
session tracking::
    Filters are not limited to the current SMTP command, they can be used to
 make a decision that depends on an email session: thanks to this tracking,
 you can reject a mail at DATA-time because there were too many errors at
 RCPT-time.
greylisting::
    Because it is written in C instead of perl, and because it uses
 tokyocabinet instead of BerkeleyDB, the greylisting of postlicyd is very fast
 and can process many thousand of requests per second. The database cleanup is
 also faster (20 times faster for 1,000,000 of triplets) and the database
 storage is more compact.
r(h)bl::
    +postlicyd+ can perform r(h)bl lookups using DNS (with the efficient DNS
 resolution and caching of unbound), or by directly loading rbl data from a
 rbldns zone file. Local lookup is highly encouraged since it dramatically
 reduces the lookup latency. postlicyd uses very efficient and compact
 ram-based lookup structures for the lookups allowing several millions of
 lookups per second in RBL zones, and several hundred of thousands of lookups
 per second in RHBL zones.
spf::
    +postlicyd+ supports +SPF+ (Sender Policy Framework). This is a DNS based
 authentication mechanism for emails. Even if SPF is slow (it may perform up
 to 30 DNS lookup per query), it is a powerful solution to limit phishing.
rate control::
    +postlicyd+ can apply policy depending on the emission rate of a server, a
 network, an recipient address...
custom matching::
    the lookup structures used for the lookup in rhbl zone files can also be
 used to build filters against a custom set of data: matching the sender or
 the recipient address against a list of emails, whitelisting (or
 blacklisting) a list of hostnames... You can also give condition on the
 fields of the link:http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_POLICY_README.html#protocol[policy query]:
 match "stress" against "yes" to change the behaviour of postlicyd when
 postfix is in link:http://www.postfix.org/STRESS_README.html["stress" mode],
 match "client" against "unknown" to apply a specific filter when the client
 has no reverse DNS...

Resources
~~~~~~~~~

+postlicyd+ is designed for speed and efficiency. The program itself has a
 very small memory footprint, but because it keeps its lookup structures in
 RAM, the memory consumption depends on the configuration. Follows a
 description of memory consumption of the filters:

* Memory usage:
** IP lookup tables: 1MB + (2 * nb of IP)
** String lookup tables: from 80% to 150% of the size of the file.
** Greylist: ~100MB for 1,000,000 of entries.
* Performances of the lookup tables on a Celeron 1.2GHz:
** IP lookup table: 23,800,000 lookups per second
** String lookup tables: 1,600,000 lookups per second (depends on the depth of the search).
** Greylisting: performances of tokyocabinet (depends on the number of entries).

OPTIONS
-------

the `conf` argument shall be a path to a valid linkgit:postlicyd.conf[5] file.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The sources include an example configuration 'example/postlicyd.conf' that
 describes all the available options. You can read the page linkgit:postlicyd.conf[5]
 for description of postlicyd.conf format and a comprehensive list of
 configuration options.

This section describes a small list of configuration for +postlicyd+, giving a
 preview of some of its capabilities.

Simple greylister
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example describe the configuration of postlicyd and postfix to run a
 simple greylister.

'/etc/pfixtools/postlicyd.conf':
-----
# Description of the greylister
greylist {              # name of the filter
  type = greylist;      # type of the filter

  # where to store the database
  path   = /var/spool/pfixtools;
  prefix = greylist_;
  # Use default limits and timeouts

  # The greylist filters can reply either greylist or whitelist
  # Answer is greylist: send a temporary error.
  on_greylist  = postfix:450 Greylisted;
  # Answer is whitelist: run following restrictions of postfix
  on_whitelist = postfix:DUNNO;
}

# Run the filter named "greylist" on recipient_restriction
recipient_filter = greylist;

# Port of the daemon
port             = 10000;
----

'/etc/postfix/main.cf':
----
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
  permit_mynetworks
  reject_unauth_destination
  check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10000
  permit
----

The following figure shows the behaviour. There's nothing complicated in this
 configuration, so the figure is quite useless, but it will make more sense
 for the following examples.

Selective greylister
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This second example shows how you can build a selective greylister with~
+postlicyd+. This configuration whitelist clients with a reverse DNS that are
 not listed in R(H)BL. Other clients go through the greylister.


'/etc/pfixtools/postlicyd.conf':
----
# Filter client without reverse DNS.
unknown_clients {
  type = match;

  condition = client_name =i unknown; # The client name is the string 'unknown'

  # The condition matched, greylist the client
  on_match = greylist;
  # The condition didn't match, lookup for the client in r(h)bl
  on_fail  = rbl;
}

# Lookup in RBLs
rbl {
  type = iplist;

  # We have a local copy of the rbldns zone file of cbl.abuseat.org
  # So use this copy.
  rbldns = nolock:1:/var/spool/pfixtools/cbl.abuseat.org;

  # dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net. does not provide a rsync service, so use dns
  dns = 1:dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net;

  # One of the filter matched, the client is listed in a rbl, go to greylist
  on_hard_match = greylist;

  # Nothing matched, try rhbl
  on_fail = rhbl;
}

# Lookup in RHBLs
rhbl {
  type = strlist;

  # Search if the domain of the sender is listed
  fields = sender_domain;

  # We have rsynced the zone files of rfc-ignorant... use them directly
  rbldns = nolock:1:/var/spool/pfixtools/bogusmx.rfc-ignorant.org;
  rbldns = nolock:1:/var/spool/pfixtools/dsn.rfc-ignorant.org;

  # The sender domain is listed
  on_hard_match = greylist;

  # It didn't matched? whitelist the client
  on_fail = postfix:DUNNO;
}

# Greylister
greylist {
  type = greylist;

  # where to store the database
  path   = /var/spool/pfixtools;
  prefix = greylist_;
  # Use default limits and timeouts

  # The greylist filters can reply either greylist or whitelist
  # Answer is greylist: send a temporary error.
  on_greylist  = postfix:450 Greylisted;
  # Answer is whitelist: run following restrictions of postfix
  on_whitelist = postfix:DUNNO;
}

# Entry point is the head of the tree.
recipient_filter = unknown_clients;
port = 10000;
----

'/etc/postfix/main.cf':
----
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
  permit_mynetworks
  reject_unauth_destination
  check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10000
  permit
----

+postlicyd+ comes with a tool that helps downloading rbl zone files. This
 tools requires a very simple configuration file that describes the sources of
 rbldns zone files.

'/etc/pfixtools/postlicyd-rsyncrbl.conf':
----
# RBL list
cbl.abuseat.org=rsync://rsync.cbl.abuseat.org/cbl/list.txt

# RHBL list
bogusmx.rfc-ignorant.org=rsync://ns0.rfc-ignorant.org/rfcirbl/bogusmx.rfc-ignorant.org
dsn.rfc-ignorant.org=rsync://ns0.rfc-ignorant.org/rfcirbl/dsn.rfc-ignorant.org
----

crontab entry:
----
15 */12 * * * root /usr/local/bin/postlicyd-rsyncrbl /etc/pfixtools/postlicyd-rsyncrbl.conf \
             /var/spool/pfixtools/ /var/run/postlicyd.pid
----

Data time greylister
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This third example, shows how to use session tracking to build a cleverer
 greylister that can reject a mail at data time if one of the recipient is
 greylisted.

'/etc/pfixtools/postlicyd.conf':
----
# Description of the greylister
greylist {              # name of the filter
  type = greylist;      # type of the filter

  # where to store the database
  path   = /var/spool/pfixtools;
  prefix = greylist_;
  # Use default limits and timeouts

  # The greylist filters can reply either greylist or whitelist
  # Answer is greylist: increment the counter 0 and send a temporary error.
  on_greylist  = counter:0:1postfix:450 Greylisted;
  # Answer is whitelist: run following restrictions of postfix
  on_whitelist = postfix:DUNNO;
}

# Check the state of the counter at data-time
post_greylist {
  type = counter;

  # Use the counter 0, the one we incremented in the greylist filter
  counter = 0;

  # The counter was not 0? Greylist
  on_hard_match = postfix:450 Greylisted;

  # The counter was 0, ignore
  on_fail = postfix:DUNNO;
}

# Run the filter named "greylist" on recipient_restriction
recipient_filter = greylist;
# Run the filter named "post_greylist" on data_restriction
data_filter = post_greylist;

# Port of the daemon
port             = 10000;
----

'/etc/postfix/main.cf':
----
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
  permit_mynetworks
  reject_unauth_destination
  check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10000
  permit

smtpd_data_restrictions =
  check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10000
----

image::images/datatime-greylist.png["Graphic view of the configuration",width=400px]

The following SMTP transaction shows the effect of this configuration: the
 mail is rejected at DATA-time because one of the recipient has been rejected.

----
220 mx.example.net ESMTP
HELO sender.example.net
250 mx.example.net
MAIL FROM: <sender@example.net>
250 2.1.0 Ok
RCPT TO: <not-greylisted@example.net>
250 2.1.5 Ok
RCPT TO: <greylisted@example.net>
450 4.7.1 <greylisted@example.net>: Recipient address rejected: Greylisted
DATA
450 4.7.1 <DATA>: Data command rejected: Greylisted
----

This example aims at giving a preview of the use of mail-session counters. The
 same behaviour could be achieved by returning 421 to postfix when greylisting
 a recipient since this return code causes the connection to be closed by
 postfix.
