NAME
----
postlicyd.conf-greylist - configuration of the greylist filter of postlicyd

SYNOPSIS
--------
The greylister uses a quite common greylist algorithm (mainly inspired from
 link:http://postgrey.schweikert.ch/[postgrey]). It uses 2 files to store its
 databases. The first one is for the greylisting database
 ('path/prefix_greylist.db', the second one is for the autowhitelister
 ('path/prefix_whitelist.db'), where +path+Â and +prefix+ are two parameters of
 the filter.

PARAMETERS
----------
The valid parameters are:
+path = path ;+::
    Directory where the database is stored. This parameter is mandatory

+prefix = string ;+::
    String prepended to the name of the database files. Default one is empty.
 You may choose the set a prefix if you want to setup several greylisters.

+lookup_by_host = boolean ;+::
    When performing a lookup, if a the hostname contains the last number of
 the IP, then the IP is used by the greylister. In the other case, we use the
 IP used is the IP of a domain that contains this IP. If this flag is set to
 true, the domain behaviour is disabled, and matching is always performed with
 the IP of the host. Default value is false.

+no_sender = boolean ;+::
    Greylisting is performed on a tuple (+client_address+, +sender+,
 +recipient+). If this option is set to true, the tuple only contains the
 client address (modified as explained in +lookup_by_host+ and the recipient.
 Default value is false (do include the sender).

+no_recipient = boolean ;+::
    same as +no_sender+ but excludes the +recipient+ from the tuple. Default
 value is false. You must set this value to true if you want to use a
 greylister before +MAIL FROM+ is received.

+delay = integer ;+::
    number a tuple is greylisted (this is the number of seconds before a
 retrial with the same tuple can be accepted. Default value is 300 (5 minutes).

+retry_window = integer ;+::
    number of seconds we wait for a retry. If a retrial happen after the
 +retry_window+ expired, the client is greylisted (again). Default value is
 172800 (2 days).

+client_awl = integer ;+::
    number of times a client must pass the greylister before being whitelisted.
 Default value is 5.

+max_age = integer ;+::
    maximum age of an entry in the database. Too old entries are automatically
 deleted. Default value is 108000 (30 hours).

+cleanup_period = integer ;+::
    minimum number of seconds between 2 cleanups of the database. The cleanup
 of the database is very important since it removes useless entries and do a
 compaction of the database. This makes lookups faster and reduces the memory
 consumption of the greylister.

+normalize_sender = boolean ;+::
    by default, the greylister do not use the +sender+ address as is: it runs
 a normalizer on it to remove username extension (in +username+ext@example.com+,
 the normalizer produces +username@example.com+) and factorize number
 (+toto1736849@example.com+ is normalized to +toto#@example.com+). You can
 choose to disable this behaviour using this parameter. As a consequence, the
 greylister might be more aggressive. +
  this parameter has been introduced in +postlicyd+ 0.8.

RESULTS
-------
The filter can returns the following values:

* if the client is whitelisted, returns +whitelist+
* if the client is greylisted, returns +greylist+

EXAMPLE
-------
----
# Perform greylisting
greylist {
  type   = greylist;

  # configuration
  path   = /var/spool/postlicyd/;
  prefix = greylist_;

  # hooks
  on_greylist  = postfix:DEFER_IF_PERMIT optional text;
  on_whitelist = postfix:OK;
}
