NAME
----
postlicyd.conf-hang - configuration of the hang filter of postlicyd

SYNOPSIS
--------
The +hang+ filter is a very simple filter. It wait until a specified amout of
 millisecond ellapsed. Since postfix waits for a reply of postlicyd before
 answering the SMTP client, this can be used to simulate a hang in postfix.
 Hang on connection has been reported to discourage some spambot with very
 short read timeouts.

This filter type has been introduced in +postlicyd+ 0.7.

PARAMETERS
----------
Its parameters are:

+timeout_ms = integer ;+::
    Number of milliseconds the filter will hang.

RESULTS
-------
It has only one possible exit: +timeout+, so, you must provide a +on_timeout+
 hook.

EXAMPLE
-------
----
hang {
  type = hang;

  # Wait 1.5 seconds before giving an answer
  timeout_ms = 1500;

  #
  on_timeout = postfix:DUNNO;
}
