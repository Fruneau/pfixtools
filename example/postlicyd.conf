# POSTLICYD configuration
#
# Postlicyd configuration contains:
#  - a set of filter definition
#  - the entry point in the filters for each smtp states
#
# The configuration format use 2 types of data:
#   Token:  [[:alpha:]]([[:alnum:]_]*)
#   String: string format is a bit more complex. It can be one of the two following
#           format:
#       - C-like strings "[^\n\r]*". In this kind of string, the \ character is used to
#         escape any character \c = c (\n = n, \\ = \, ...). This format allow non-ascii
#         strings and string concatenation " abcd " "ef" = " abcd ef".
#       - ASCII-only strings can be written without double-quotes. They can be splitted
#         into several lines using shell-like escaping of EOL. A string begins and ends on
#         on a non-blank character. This king of string can not contain semi-colons.
# eg:
#  The following format are equivalent:
#   (1) this is a str\
#   (1)    ing
#
#   (2) "this is a string"
#
#   (3) "this " "is a "
#   (3) "string"
#
# Most of the configuration use a format:
#     Token = String ;
#
# When not in a string, spaces and line breaks are ignored. You can use comments
# everywhere out of a string. It starts with a '#' character and ends at the end of the
# line. Comments are strictly equivalents to white spaces.

# FILTER DEFINITION
#
# A definition of a filter contains:
#  - the name of the filter. This name MUST be uniq (non-uniq names can lead to undefined
#    behaviour)
#  - a type
#  - a list of type-specific parameters
#  - a list of hooks (on_hookname)
#
# Format:
#  A filter look likes that:
#
#  filter_name {
#    type = type_name;
#    param1 = parameter value 1;
#    ...
#    on_hook1 = action1;
#    on_hook2 = action2;
#    ...
#  }
#
# Hooks:
#   A filter can returns different values. Each return value is given a name. The
#   configuration associates an action to run to a return value name.
#
#   A hook action has the format: (counter:id:incr:)?(filter_name|postfix:ACTION)
#
#   The action can contains the reference to a counter to update. This counters are "message"-wide
#   counters that stay valid until the end of the filtering of the message. This counters are useful
#   to trig different actions depending on the number of failures encountered during the processing
#   of a message. There are 64 counters (0..63), accessible from all the filters. By specifying
#   counter:id:incr as a prefix of the hook action, you tell postlicyd to add (incr) to counter
#   (id) when this hook is reached. The "counter" filter type allow you to run actions depending
#   on the value of a counter.
#
#   The action can be either a postfix access(5) value or a filter name. Postfix access
#   parameters must be prefixed by 'postfix:'. The text argument given to a postfix reply
#   may contain format strings to be replaced by the parameters of the query. This arguments
#   have the following format: ${fieldname}
#
# eg:
#   on_match = postfix:REJECT Blacklisted;
#   on_fail  = postfix:450 Greylisted, see http://www.example.org/${sender_domain}.html
#   on_error = counter:0:1:postfix:DUNNO
#   on_match = counter:63:10:whitelist
#
# Filter:
#   Current defined filter types are:
#     - iplist: match the client_address against one or more blacklist files from a rbl
#        Parameters:
#           - file: (no)?lock:weight:filename
#             declare a file to load. If lock is given, the klist is locked into the
#             RAM. The weight is a number giving the weight of this blaclist file in the
#             score of the IP
#           - rbldns: (no)?lock:weight:filename
#             this is an alias for file.
#           - dns: weight:hostname
#             use a rbl via DNS resolution with the given weight. If a DNS lookup error occurs
#             the IP is considered as beeing "not found".
#           - soft_threshold: score (default: 1)
#             minimum score to match the soft_match return value
#           - hard_threshold: score (default: 1)
#             minimum score to match the hard_match return value
#        Return value:
#          The score of a query is the sum of the weight of the blacklist it matched.
#           - If the IP can not be parsed, returns error
#           - If no rbl was available (no file and all dns down), returns error.
#           - If the score is strictly greater >= than hard_threshold, returns hard_match
#           - If the score is strictly greater >= than soft_threshold, returns soft_match
#           - Else, returns fail

# Lookup in a rbl
spamhaus_and_abuseat {
  type   = iplist;

  # configuration
  file   = lock:10:/var/spool/postlicyd/rbl.spamhaus.org;
  file   = lock:1:/var/spool/postlicyd/cbl.abuseat.org;
  soft_threshold = 1;
  hard_threshold = 11;

  # hooks
  on_soft_match = greylist;
  on_hard_match = postfix:REJECT optional text;
  on_fail       = postfix:OK;
  on_error      = postfix:DUNNO;
}


#     - strlist: match strings from the query against a list of list.
#        Parameters:
#           - file: (no)?lock:(partial-)?(pre|suf)fix:weight:filename
#             declare a file to load. If lock is given, the list is locked into the
#             RAM. Prefix/Suffix is a parameter to tell the matcher which is the most
#             efficient storage order. The strings are internally stored into a trie that
#             allow high compression if a lot of prefix are shared by several strings. If
#             you choose "prefix", string are stored in the natural order in memory and
#             prefix compression is performed. If you choose "suffix", strings are stored
#             in reverse order in memory and suffix compression is performed. If you add "partial-"
#             to the match order, the entry will match if the file contains a prefix (resp. suffix)
#             of the string. The weight is a number giving the weight of this list in the string score.
#               e.g.:
#                * a file that contains ".polytechnique.org" in "partial-suffix" mode will match
#                 all subdomains of "polytechnique.org".
#                * a file that contains "postmaster@" in "partial-prefix" mode will match all
#                 postmaster emails.
#                * a file open without "partial-" modifier match exact strings.
#           - rbldns: (no)?lock:weight:filename
#             declare a rbldns zone file to load. This is exactly the same as file excepted that it wraps
#             parsing of hostname to split them into 2 categories:
#               * names beginning with '*' are sorted as 'domains' and are matched as suffix
#               * names starting with an alphanumirical character are sorted as 'hostnames' and are
#                process via exact matching.
#           - dns: weight:hostname
#             use a rhbl via DNS resolution with the given weight. If a DNS lookup error occurs
#             the hostname is considered as beeing "not found". This can only be used with "hostnames"
#             typed fields.
#           - soft_threshold: score (default: 1)
#             minimum score to match the soft_match return value
#           - hard_threshold: score (default: 1)
#             minimum score to match the hard_match return value
#           - fields: field_name(,field_name)*
#             list of field the match the string against.
#             currently only email OR hostname fields are supported. You MUST choose only
#             one of these types per strlist, and be carefull that the field you requested
#             are available in the protocol state you want to use this filter for.
#              * hostname fields: helo_name, client_name, reverse_client_name, sender_domain,
#                         recipient_domain
#              * email fields: sender, recipient
#             No space is allowed in this parameter.
#        Return value:
#          The score of a query is the sum of the weight of the list it matched.
#           - If no rhbl was available (no file and all dns down), returns error.
#           - If the score is strictly greater >= than hard_threshold, returns hard_match
#           - If the score is strictly greater >= than soft_threshold, returns soft_match
#           - Else, returns fail
#        State:
#           - to match helo_name, you must be on HELO state or later
#           (stmpd_helo_restrictions)
#           - to match sender, you must be on MAIL state or later
#           (smtpd_sender_restrictions)
#           - to match recipient, you must on RCPT state (stmpd_recipient_restrictions)
