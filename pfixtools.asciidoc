NAME
----
pfixtools - the Postfix Tools Suite

SYNOPSIS
--------
pfixtools


DESCRIPTION
-----------

pfixtools is a suite of tools aiming at complementing postfix, to make it even
more customizable, while keeping really high performance levels. This is in
particular why all the major Postfix Tools are written in plain C.

This suite contains at the time of the writing, two major tools.

linkgit:pfix-srsd[8,pfix-srsd/pfix-srsd.html]::
    this daemon brings SRS to postfix using its
    link:http://www.postfix.org/tcp_table.5.html[tcp_table(5)] or
    link:http://www.postfix.org/socketmap_table.5.html[socketmap_table(5)] mechanisms. It
    allows plugging +SRS+ into
    link:http://www.postfix.org/canonical.5.html[canonical(5)] or
    link:http://www.postfix.org/transport.5.html[transport(5)] rewrites quite easily.

linkgit:postlicyd[8,postlicyd/postlicyd.html]::
    this is a postfix policy daemon. It includes greylisting, rbl lookups,
    counters, SMTP session tracking, in a way that allow very fine grained
    schemes. It's for example quite easy to reject a mail just at the
    `SMTP` `DATA` command using results from filtering done at the `RCPT TO`
    or even the `MAIL FROM` commands.
+
Its configuration file is described in
linkgit:postlicyd.conf[5,postlicyd/postlicyd.conf.html].
